                "Martin Luther, to all faithful and godly pastors and preachers: grace, mercy, and peace be yours in Jesus Christ, our Lord.\n\nThe deplorable, miserable conditions which I recently observed when visiting the parishes have constrained and pressed me to put this catechism of Christian doctrine into this brief, plain, and simple form. How pitiable, so help me God, were the things I saw: the common man, especially in the villages, knows practically nothing of Christian doctrine, and many of the pastors are almost entirely incompetent and unable to teach. Yet all the people are supposed to be Christians, have been baptized, and receive the Holy Sacrament even though they do not know the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, or the Ten Commandments and live like poor animals of the barnyard and pigpen. What these people have mastered, however, is the fine art of tearing all Christian liberty to shreds.\n\nOh, you bishops! How will you ever answer to Christ for letting the people carry on so disgracefully and not attending to the duties of your office even for a moment? One can only hope judgment does not strike you! You command the Sacrament in one kind only, insist on the observance of your human ways, and yet are unconcerned whether the people know the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the Ten Commandments, or indeed any of God's Word. Woe, woe to you forever!\n\nTherefore dear brothers, for God's sake I beg all of you who are pastors and preachers to devote yourselves sincerely to the duties of your office, that you feel compassion for the people entrusted to your care, and that you help us accordingly to inculcate this catechism in the people, especially the young. If you cannot do more, at least take the tables and charts for catechism instruction and drill the people in them word for word, in the following way:",
                "*First*, the pastor should most carefully avoid teaching the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the sacraments, etc., according to various texts and differing forms. Let him adopt one version, stay with it, and from one year to the next keep using it unchanged. Young and inexperienced persons must be taught a single fixed form or they will easily become confused, and the result will be that all previous effort and labor will be lost. There should be no change, even though one may wish to improve the text.\n\nThe honored fathers understood this well, and therefore they all consistently used one form of the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments. We should do as they did by teaching these materials to the young and the common man without altering a single syllable and by never varying their wording when presenting or quoting them year after year.\n\nSo adopt whatever form you wish, and then stick with it at all times. If, however, you happen to be preaching to some sophisticated, learned audience, then you certainly may demonstrate your skill with words by turning phrases as colorfully and masterfully as you can. But with young persons keep to a single, fixed, and permanent form and wording, and teach them first of all the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, etc., according to the text, word for word, so that they can repeat it after you and commit it to memory.\n\nBut those who refuse to learn are to be told that they are denying Christ and do not belong to Him. They are not to be admitted to the Sacrament, accepted as sponsors at Baptism, or allowed to exercise Christian liberty in any way. They should instead be simply directed back to the pope and his functionaries, yes, even to Satan himself. Moreover, their parents and superiors should refuse them food and drink, telling them that the prince is of a mind to expel such rude persons from his realm, and so on.",
                "Of course we cannot, and we should not try to, force the Christian faith on anyone. Yet we should steadily keep on urging people toward it and help them know what is considered right and wrong in the society in which they want to live and earn their living. A person who wants to live in a certain city and enjoy its privileges should know and observe its laws, no matter whether he believes in them or is at heart a rogue or scoundrel.\n\n*Second*, after they have well memorized the text (of the catechism), then explain the meaning so that they understand what they are saying. Do so again with the help of these charts or some other brief uniform method of your choosing; adhere to it and do not change a single syllable, as said above concerning the text, taking your time with it. For it is not necessary to teach everything at once, but one thing after the other. After they understand well the meaning of the First Commandment, proceed to the Second, and so on, otherwise they will be too overwhelmed to the point of remembering nothing.\n\n*Third*, after you have so taught them this short catechism, take up the Large Catechism and use it to give them a broader and richer understanding. Here enlarge on every individual commandment, petition, segment, explaining in each case the various words, uses, benefits, dangers, and hurts involved, as you will find them amply described in many a book dealing with these topics. Stress especially that commandment or any other specific part of the catechism doctrine which your people neglect most. For example, among craftsmen and merchants, farmers and employees, you must powerfully stress the Seventh Commandment, which forbids stealing, because among such people many kinds of dishonesty and thievery occur. Also, for young persons and the common man you must stress the Fourth Commandment, urging them to be orderly, faithful, obedient, and peaceable, always bringing in many Bible examples of how God punished or blessed such people.",
                "You should particularly urge those in authority and parents to govern the young well and to send them to school. Show them why it is their duty to do this and explain what a damnable sin it is if they fail to do so. For by such neglect they ruin and destroy both the kingdom of God and that of this world and prove themselves to be the worst enemies of both God and man. Thoroughly underscore what terrible harm they do by not helping train children to become pastors, preachers, writers, and the like, and how God will punish them for it. There is a great need to preach about these things. For parents and those in authority are guilty beyond words in this regard, and the devil has horrible things in mind.\n\n*Finally*, now that the pope's tyranny is over, people no longer want to go to the Sacrament but despise it. Here again urging is necessary, however, with the understanding that we are not to force anyone into the faith or to the Sacrament, nor set any law, time, or place for it. Our preaching should instead be such that of their own accord and without our command, people feel constrained themselves and press us pastors to serve the Sacrament. The way to go about this is to tell them that if anyone does not seek or desire the Lord's Supper at the very least four times a year, it is to be feared that he despises the Sacrament and is not Christian, just as no one is a Christian who does not believe or hear the Gospel. For Christ did not say, \"Omit this\" or \"despise this,\" but \"This do, as often as you drink it,\" etc. He most certainly wants it done and does not want it left undone and despised. \"This do,\" He says.",
                "For a person not to prize highly the Sacrament is tantamount to saying that he has no sin, no flesh, no devil, no world, no death, no danger, no hell. That is to say, he believes in none of these although he is overwhelmed by them and is the devil's possession twice over. On the other hand, he needs no grace, life, paradise, kingdom of heaven, Christ, God, or any good thing. Surely, if he recognized how much evil is in him and how much he needs all the good things he lacks, he would not neglect the Sacrament, which gives help against such evil and bestows so much goodness. He will not need to be forced by law to the Sacrament but will himself come running in a hurry to the Lord's Table, constrained within himself and pressing you to give him the Sacrament.\n\nTherefore do not set up any law concerning it, as the pope does. Only emphasize clearly the benefit, need, usefulness, and blessing connected with the Sacrament, and also the harm and danger of neglecting it. The people will then come of themselves without your using compulsion. But if they still do not come, then let them go their way and tell them that all who are insensitive or unaware of their great need and God's gracious help belong to the devil. But if you fail to urge these things or if you make it into law and bitterness, then the fault will be yours if they despise the Sacrament. Why should they not be lazy if you are asleep and silent?\n\nSo look to it, you pastors and preachers. Our ministry today is something else than it was under the pope. It has become a serious and saving responsibility. Consequently it now involves much more trouble and labor, danger and trial, and in addition it brings you little of the world's gratitude and rewards. But Christ Himself will be our reward if we labor faithfully. The Father of all grace help us to do just that. To Him be praise and thanks forever through Christ our Lord. Amen."

In this Christian church He daily and richly forgives all my sins and the sins of all believers.

For without God's word the water is plain water and no Baptism. But with the word of God it is a Baptism, that is, a life-giving water, rich in grace, and a washing of the new birth in the Holy Spirit, as St. Paul says in Titus, chapter three: \"He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.

First, that we confess our sins, and second, that we receive absolution, that is, forgiveness, from the pastor as from God Himself, not doubting, but firmly believing that by it our sins are forgiven before God in heaven.\n\n**What sins should we confess?**\n\nBefore God we should plead guilty of all sins, even those we are not aware of, as we do in the Lord's Prayer; but before the pastor we should confess only those sins which we know and feel in our hearts.\n\n**Which are these?**\n\nConsider your place in life according to the Ten Commandments: Are you a father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, or worker? Have you been disobedient, unfaithful, or lazy? Have you been hot-tempered, rude, or quarrelsome? Have you hurt someone by your words or deeds? Have you stolen, been negligent, wasted anything, or done any harm?",
                "**A Short Form of Confession**\n\n[Luther intended the following form to serve only as an example of private confession for Christians of his time. For a contemporary form of individual confession, see Lutheran Worship, pp. 310-11; see Lutheran Service Book, pp. 292-93.]\n\n**The penitent says:**\n\nDear confessor, I ask you please to hear my confession and to pronounce forgiveness in order to fulfill God's will.\n\nI, a poor sinner, plead guilty before God of all sins. In particular I confess before you that as a servant, maid, etc., I, sad to say, serve my master unfaithfully, for in this and that I have not done what I was told to do. I have made him angry and caused him to curse. I have been negligent and allowed damage to be done. I have also been offensive in words and deeds. I have quarreled with my peers. I have grumbled about the lady of the house and cursed her. I am sorry for all of this and I ask for grace. I want to do better.\n\n**A master or lady of the house may say:**\n\nIn particular I confess before you that I have not faithfully guided my children, servants, and wife to the glory of God. I have cursed. I have set a bad example by indecent words and deeds. I have hurt my neighbor and spoken evil of him. I have overcharged, sold inferior merchandise, and given less than was paid for.\n\n*[Let the penitent confess whatever else he has done against God's commandments and his own position.]*\n\nIf, however, someone does not find himself burdened with these or greater sins, he should not trouble himself or search for or invent other sins, and thereby make confession a torture. Instead, he should mention one or two that he knows: In particular I confess that I have cursed; I have used improper words; I have neglected this or that, etc. Let that be enough.\n\nBut if you know of none at all (which hardly seems possible), then mention none in particular, but receive the forgiveness upon the general confession which you make to God before the confessor.",
                "**Then the confessor shall say:**\n\nGod be merciful to you and strengthen your faith. Amen.\n\n**Furthermore:**\n\nDo you believe that my forgiveness is God's forgiveness? Yes, dear confessor.\n\n**Then let him say:**\n\nLet it be done for you as you believe. And I, by the command of our Lord Jesus Christ, forgive you your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Go in peace.\n\nA confessor will know additional passages with which to comfort and to strengthen the faith of those who have great burdens of conscience or are sorrowful and distressed.\n\nThis is intended only as a general form of confession.",
                "**What is the Office of the Keys?\\***\n\nThe Office of the Keys is that special authority which Christ has given to His church on earth to forgive the sins of repentant sinners, but to withhold forgiveness from the unrepentant as long as they do not repent.\n\n**Where is this written?\\***\n\nThis is what St. John the Evangelist writes in chapter twenty: The Lord Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.\" (John 20:22-23)\n\n**What do you believe according to these words?\\***\n\nI believe that when the called ministers of Christ deal with us by His divine command, in particular when they exclude openly unrepentant sinners from the Christian congregation and absolve those who repent of their sins and want to do better, this is just as valid and certain, even in heaven, as if Christ our dear Lord dealt with us Himself.\n\n\\*This question may not have been composed by Luther himself but reflects his teaching and was included in editions of the catechism during his lifetime."

                "*As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household:*\n\n**What is the Sacrament of the Altar?**\n\nIt is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under the bread and wine, instituted by Christ Himself for us Christians to eat and to drink.\n\n**Where is this written?**\n\nThe holy Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and St. Paul write: Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said: \"Take, eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.\"\n\nIn the same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, \"Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\"\n\n**What is the benefit of this eating and drinking?**\n\nThese words, \"Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins,\" show us that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us through these words. For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation.\n\n**How can bodily eating and drinking do such great things?**\n\nCertainly not just eating and drinking do these things, but the words written here: \"Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.\" These words, along with the bodily eating and drinking, are the main thing in the Sacrament. Whoever believes these words has exactly what they say: \"forgiveness of sins.\"\n\n**Who receives this sacrament worthily?**\n\nFasting and bodily preparation are certainly fine outward training. But that person is truly worthy and well prepared who has faith in these words: \"Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.\"\n\nBut anyone who does not believe these words or doubts them is unworthy and unprepared, for the words \"for you\" require all hearts to believe."

Amen.\n\n*Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. If you choose, you may also say this little prayer:*\n\nI thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray that You would keep me this day also from sin and every evil, that all my doings and life may please You. For into Your hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the evil foe may have no power over me. Amen.\n\n*Then go joyfully to your work, singing a hymn, like that of the Ten Commandments, or whatever your devotion may suggest.*\n\n**Evening Prayer**\n\n*In the evening when you go to bed, make the sign of the holy cross and say:*\n\nIn the name of the Father and of the + Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n*Then kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. If you choose, you may also say this little prayer:*\n\nI thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have graciously kept me this day; and I pray that You would forgive me all my sins where I have done wrong, and graciously keep me this night. For into Your hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the evil foe may have no power over me.

                "*How the head of the family should teach his household to ask a blessing and return thanks:*\n\n**Asking a Blessing**\n\n*The children and members of the household shall go to the table reverently, fold their hands, and say:*\n\nThe eyes of all look to You, [O LORD,] and You give them their food at the proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing. (Ps. 145: 15-16)\n\n*Then shall be said the Lord's Prayer and the following:*\n\nLord God, heavenly Father, bless us and these Your gifts which we receive from Your bountiful goodness, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.\n\n**Returning Thanks**\n\n*Also, after eating, they shall, in like manner, reverently and with folded hands say:*\n\nGive thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His love endures forever. [He] gives food to every creature. He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call. His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight in the legs of a man; the LORD delights in those who fear Him, who put their hope in His unfailing love. (Ps. 136:1, 25; 147:9-11)\n\n*Then shall be said the Lord's Prayer and the following:*\n\nWe thank You, Lord God, heavenly Father, for all Your benefits, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen."

                "*Certain passages of Scripture for various holy orders and positions, admonishing them about their duties and responsibilities:*\n\n**To Bishops, Pastors, and Preachers**\n\nThe overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. 1 Tim. 3:2-4\n\nHe must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 1 Tim. 3:6\n\nHe must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. Titus 1:9",
                "**What the Hearers Owe Their Pastors**\n\nThe Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. 1 Cor. 9:14\n\nAnyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Gal. 6:6-7\n\nThe elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, \"Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,\" and \"The worker deserves his wages.\" 1 Tim. 5:17-18\n\nWe ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 1 Thess. 5:12-13\n\nObey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you. Heb. 13:17",
                "**Of Civil Government**\n\nEveryone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrong-doer. Rom. 13:1-4",
                "**Of Citizens**\n\nGive to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. Matt. 22:21\n\nIt is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. Rom. 13:5-7\n\nI urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone-for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior. 1 Tim. 2:1-3\n\nRemind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good. Titus 3:1\n\nSubmit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 1 Peter 2:13-14",
                "**To Husbands**\n\nHusbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. 1 Peter 3:7\n\nHusbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Col. 3:19\n\n**To Wives**\n\nWives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. Eph. 5:22\n\nThey were submissive to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. 1 Peter 3:5-6",
                "**To Parents**\n\nFathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Eph. 6:4\n\n**To Children**\n\nChildren, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. \"Honor your father and your mother\"-which is the first commandment with a promise-\"that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.\" Eph. 6:1-3",
                "**To Workers of All Kinds**\n\nSlaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free. Eph. 6:5-8\n\n**To Employers and Supervisors**\n\nMasters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him. Eph. 6:9",
                "**To Youth**\n\nYoung men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, \"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\" Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time. 1 Peter 5:5-6\n\n**To Widows**\n\nThe widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 1 Tim. 5:5-6",
                "**To Everyone**\n\nThe commandments ... are summed up in this one rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" Rom. 13:9\n\nI urge ... that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone. 1 Tim. 2:1\n\nLet each his lesson learn with care, and all the household well shall fare."

Do you believe that you are a sinner?**\n\nYes, I believe it. I am a sinner.",
                "**2. How do you know this?**\n\nFrom the Ten Commandments, which I have not kept.",
                "**3. Are you sorry for your sins?**\n\nYes, I am sorry that I have sinned against God.",
                "**4. What have you deserved from God because of your sins?**\n\nHis wrath and displeasure, temporal death, and eternal damnation. See Rom. 6:21, 23.",
                "**5. Do you hope to be saved?**\n\nYes, that is my hope.",
                "**6. In whom then do you trust?**\n\nIn my dear Lord Jesus Christ.",
                "**7. Who is Christ?**\n\nThe Son of God, true God and man.",
                "**8. How many Gods are there?**\n\nOnly one, but there are three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.",
                "**9. What has Christ done for you that you trust in Him?**\n\nHe died for me and shed His blood for me on the cross for the forgiveness of sins.",
                "**10. Did the Father also die for you?**\n\nHe did not. The Father is God only, as is the Holy Spirit; but the Son is both true God and true man. He died for me and shed His blood for me.",
                "**11. How do you know this?**\n\nFrom the holy Gospel, from the words instituting the Sacrament, and by His body and blood given me as a pledge in the Sacrament.",
                "**12. What are the words of institution?**\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said: \"Take eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.\"\n\nIn the same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying: \"Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\"",
                "**13. Do you believe, then, that the true body and blood of Christ are in the Sacrament?**\n\nYes, I believe it.",
                "**14. What convinces you to believe this?**\n\nThe word of Christ: Take, eat, this is My body; drink of it, all of you, this is My blood.",
                "**15. What should we do when we eat His body and drink His blood, and in this way receive His pledge?**\n\nWe should remember and proclaim His death and the shedding of His blood, as He taught us: This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.",
                "**16. Why should we remember and proclaim His death?**\n\nFirst, so that we may learn to believe that no creature could make satisfaction for our sins. Only Christ, true God and man, could do that. Second, so we may learn to be horrified by our sins, and to regard them as very serious. Third, so we may find joy and comfort in Christ alone, and through faith in Him be saved.",
                "**17. What motivated Christ to die and make full payment for your sins?**\n\nHis great love for His Father and for me and other sinners, as it is written in John 14; Romans 5; Galatians 2; and Ephesians 5.",
                "**18. Finally, why do you wish to go to the Sacrament?**\n\nThat I may learn to believe that Christ, out of great love, died for my sin, and also learn from Him to love God and my neighbor.",
                "**19. What should admonish and encourage a Christian to receive the Sacrament frequently?**\n\nFirst, both the command and the promise of Christ the Lord. Second, his own pressing need, because of which the command, encouragement, and promise are given.",
                "**20. But what should you do if you are not aware of this need and have no hunger and thirst for the Sacrament?**\n\nTo such a person no better advice can be given than this: first, he should touch his body to see if he still has flesh and blood. Then he should believe what the Scriptures say of it in Galatians 5 and Romans 7. Second, he should look around to see whether he is still in the world, and remember that there will be no lack of sin and trouble, as the Scriptures say in John 15-16 and in 1 John 2 and 5.\n\nThird, he will certainly have the devil also around him, who with his lying and murdering day and night will let him have no peace, within or without, as the Scriptures picture him in John 8 and 16; 1 Peter 5; Ephesians 6; and 2 Timothy 2.\n\n*Note:* These questions and answers are no child's play, but are drawn up with great earnestness of purpose by the venerable and devout Dr. Luther for both young and old. Let each one pay attention and consider it a serious matter; for St. Paul writes to the Galatians in chapter six: \"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.\""
