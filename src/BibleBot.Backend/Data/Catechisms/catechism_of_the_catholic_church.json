For this reason, at every time and in every place, God draws close to man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his strength. He calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into the unity of his family, the Church. To accomplish this, when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Savior. In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life."

In the great era of the Fathers of the Church, saintly bishops devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis.

It gave catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the origin of the *Roman Catechism,* which is also known by the name of that council and which is a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian teaching....\" The Council of Trent initiated a remarkable organization of the Church's catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy bishops and theologians such as St. Peter Canisius, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo, or St. Robert Bellarmine, it occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms."

The Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in 1985 asked \"that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed.\" The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish his own, acknowledging that \"this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church and of the particular Churches.\" He set in motion everything needed to carry out the Synod Fathers' wish."

The profession of faith summarizes the gifts that God gives man: as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as Sanctifier. It develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal faith in the one God: the almighty *Father,* the Creator; his *Son* Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior; and the *Holy Spirit,* the Sanctifier, in the Holy Church (*Section Two*)."

Such indispensable adaptations are the responsibility of particular catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the faithful:\n\n> Whoever teaches must become \"all things to all men\" (*1 Cor* 9:22), to win everyone to Christ.... Above all, teachers must not imagine that a single kind of soul has been entrusted to them, and that consequently it is lawful to teach and form equally all the faithful in true piety with one and the same method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as newborn babes, others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full command of their powers.... Those who are called to the ministry of preaching must suit their words to the maturity and understanding of their hearers, as they hand on the teaching of the mysteries of faith and the rules of moral conduct.\n\nAbove All-Charity"

Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."

Faith is man's response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. Thus we shall consider first that search (*Chapter One*), then the divine Revelation by which God comes to meet man (*Chapter Two*), and finally the response of faith (*Chapter Three*)."

Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for: (355, 170, 1718)\n\n> The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists, it is because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator."

Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.

(2567, 845, 368)\n\n> You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power and your wisdom is without measure. And man, so small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small part of your creation, wants to praise you.

For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin.

To this \"order of penitents\" (which concerned only certain grave sins), one was only rarely admitted and in certain regions only once in a lifetime. During the seventh century Irish missionaries, inspired by the Eastern monastic tradition, took to continental Europe the \"private\" practice of penance, which does not require public and prolonged completion of penitential works before reconciliation with the Church.

This new practice envisioned the possibility of repetition and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of this sacrament.

These two punishments must not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without, but as following from the very nature of sin.

It is lived out in prayer, above all in the Eucharist.

For God can be appeased only by prayers that make peace. To God, the better offering is peace, brotherly concord, and a people made one in the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."

It is difficult to translate the Greek verb used by a single English word: the Greek means both \"do not allow us to enter into temptation\" and \"do not let us yield to temptation.\" \"God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one\"; on the contrary, he wants to set us free from evil. We ask him not to allow us to take the way that leads to sin. We are engaged in the battle \"between flesh and spirit\"; this petition implores the Spirit of discernment and strength. (164, 2516)"

(2284)\n\n> God does not want to impose the good, but wants free beings.... There is a certain usefulness to temptation. No one but God knows what our soul has received from him, not even we ourselves. But temptation reveals it in order to teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we discover our evil inclinations and are obliged to give thanks for the goods that temptation has revealed to us."
